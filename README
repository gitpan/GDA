1.0 INTRODUCTION

This is a set of Perl bindings to the GNOME-DB project's GNU Data
Access (GDA) library (libgda*.a). The implementation requires the
Inline module, which is available via the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN) -- see http://www.cpan.org/.

Following usual practice, unpack the tarball, cd into it and do:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install


2.0 UTILITIES

In addition to the Perl bindings themselves, the following utility
programs are provided:

  * gda-ls-providers
  * gda-ls-log

See the source code (in the script/ directory) and/or manual pages
for more information.


3.0 STATUS

Proof-of-concept only.
